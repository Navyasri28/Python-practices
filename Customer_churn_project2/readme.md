### Comprehensive Analysis Overview

In analyzing the customer churn dataset, we began by loading and exploring the data, identifying and handling null values, and addressing outliers to ensure a clean dataset. We performed univariate analysis, examining the distribution of key variables like `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, and `TotalCharges`, using summary statistics and visualizations such as histograms and pie charts. For bivariate analysis, we explored relationships between pairs of variables, such as `tenure` vs. `MonthlyCharges`, using scatterplots, and examined categorical relationships like `gender` vs. `Churn` with heatmaps. This helped identify trends and correlations. Multivariate analysis was conducted to understand the interplay between multiple variables, using advanced visualizations like violin plots and box plots, to compare `MonthlyCharges` across different `Contract` types and `Churn` statuses. These comprehensive analyses provided deep insights into factors influencing customer churn, such as pricing strategies, contract types, and customer demographics, enabling data-driven decision-making for improving customer retention strategies.

## Introduction
Customer Churn: Understanding customer churn is essential for businesses to improve customer retention and develop effective strategies to keep customers.

## Import Libraries
Necessary Libraries: Import libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

## Load Data
Loading Dataset: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv.

## Data Exploration
Missing Values: Check for missing values and handle them appropriately, including converting TotalCharges to numeric and addressing any resulting NaNs.
Data Types: Ensure correct data types, particularly converting TotalCharges to a float for accurate analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
Univariate Analysis:

Numerical Variables: Analyze the distribution of tenure, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges using summary statistics and histograms.
